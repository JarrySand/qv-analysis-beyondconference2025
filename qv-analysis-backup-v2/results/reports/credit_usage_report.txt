## Considerations on the Neutral Bias Hypothesis

Credit usage analysis results **support the neutral bias hypothesis**:
- The majority of voters used almost all their credits
- Users with few remaining credits make up the majority
- Few cases where voters could have cast additional votes but did not

These suggest the existence of credit maximization behavior, consistent with the neutral bias hypothesis.
