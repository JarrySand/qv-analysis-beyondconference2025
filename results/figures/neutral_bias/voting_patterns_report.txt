## Implications for Hypotheses

### Evaluation of Neutral Bias Hypothesis

- **Support**: There are clusters where small votes (1-2) are used at a high rate for multiple projects, suggesting that many voters cast votes for projects they have little interest in.

### Evaluation of Strategic Voting Hypothesis

- **Support**: The negative correlations between projects and the presence of voters with extreme voting ratios suggest that voters may be intentionally adjusting their votes to prioritize certain projects.

### Evaluation of True Preference Reflection Hypothesis

- **Not Supported**: The low separation of voting pattern clusters suggests that the existence of clear voter groups cannot be confirmed, indicating that voting may not consistently reflect true preferences.

## Overall Conclusion

The results of the voting pattern analysis suggest that **multiple factors may be coexisting**. Elements of neutral bias, strategic voting, and true preference reflection are observed partially, suggesting the existence of complex voting behavior that cannot be explained by a single hypothesis. More detailed analysis or additional data may be needed to better understand voting behavior.
