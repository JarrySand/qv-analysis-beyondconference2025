# Neutral Bias Analysis Report

## 1. Basic Statistical Information

- Total Votes: 931
- Total Voters: 124
- Total 1-Vote Count: 138 (14.82%)
- Total 0-Vote Count: -63

## 2. Neutral Bias Test Results

- Chi-Square Value: 318.9195
- p-Value: 0.00000000
- 1-Vote Excess: 34.56 ç¥¨
- 1-Vote Excess Rate: 33.40%

**Result**: Vote values differ significantly from equal distribution. This suggests the existence of neutral bias.

## 3. 1-Vote Ratio by Project

| Project Name | Total Votes | 1-Vote Count | 1-Vote Ratio | Expected 1-Vote Count | 1-Vote Excess Rate |
|--------------|---------|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| JINEN TRAVEL | 133 | 25 | 18.80% | 14.78 | 69.17% |
| Inatori Art Center Plan | 133 | 24 | 18.05% | 14.78 | 62.41% |
| Politics to Festival Project | 133 | 21 | 15.79% | 14.78 | 42.11% |
| Para Travel Support Team | 133 | 20 | 15.04% | 14.78 | 35.34% |
| Chiba Youth Center PRISM | 133 | 17 | 12.78% | 14.78 | 15.04% |
| Awaji Island Quest College | 133 | 16 | 12.03% | 14.78 | 8.27% |
| Bio Rice Field Project | 133 | 15 | 11.28% | 14.78 | 1.50% |

## 4. Voter Pattern Analysis

| 1-Vote Usage Pattern | Number of Voters | Percentage |
|---------------|---------|------|
| Very Low 1s | 38 | 30.65% |
| Low 1s | 17 | 13.71% |
| Medium 1s | 12 | 9.68% |
| High 1s | 2 | 1.61% |
| Very High 1s | 0 | 0.00% |

## 5. Summary and Next Steps

As a result of the analysis, the voting data suggests the existence of moderate neutral bias.Specifically, 1-votes (minimum vote value) were used 33.40% more than the theoretical expected value.

Based on these results, the following additional analyses are recommended:

1. Scenario simulation: Changes in budget allocation when converting a certain percentage of 1-votes to 0-votes
2. Voter-specific analysis: Differences in the impact of neutral bias by voting pattern
3. UI design proposal: Interface improvements to reduce bias
